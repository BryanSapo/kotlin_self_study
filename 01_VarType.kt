/*

Basic data types are as follow:
Int, just sone integer number.
String, just text and symbol.
Boolean, true or false, remember that, the first of the letter can't be upper case.
Double, number with floating point.
Float, same as Double but has smaller range and when create a var of Float, it must assign to something like 0.5f or 1.8f, the 'f' is required.

If you want to check the data type of a var, you need to print something like " <var name>::class.simpleName ".
Thus, I'm not sure the symbol '::' mean, maybe I will check it later.
