# This is the note/code of me self-studying Kotlin.

Basiclly, I follow the tutorial on [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/KOTLIN/index.php), but there might be some other reference.
Also, When I have any question, I sereach on StackOverflows or ask ChatGPT to find the solutions.

The basic operations are almost the same as every language I used before, so I will skip it.
